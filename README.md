[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sensu-plugins-influxdb-metrics-checker.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/sensu-plugins-influxdb-metrics-checker)

## Background story
As soon as we started using InfluxDB we were wondering how we could read a given metric, compare it to its previous days, evaluate the percentage of difference, and act according to it.

We chose to do it as a Sensu plugin because it comes with Handlers that will allow us to extend the usability of this information, such as sending a message to slack, or sending an alert to OpsGenie.

The result is that now we are able to experiment with our metrics and alerts, giving us a better understanding of whats going on in our systems.

## What it does
The script will compare the values of yesterday at this time minus 10 minutes, with the values of today at this time minus 10 minus.
It will calculate the percentage of difference and will act on that.
You will be able to set a threshold of warning and critical values where your program will act.
It will also leave it 5 minutes to aggregate the data in influxdb, so we are more precise.

## Components
There is just one script that you can find at
 * bin/check-influxdb-metrics.rb

## Getting started

At the moment there is just one script
**check-influxdb-metrics** which you can run in a bash doing:

```
ruby check-influxdb-metrics.rb --host=metrics-influxdb.internal.com --port=8086 --user=admin --password=password -c -3 -w -10 --db=statsd_metrics --metric=api.request.counter
```

Once in Sensu:
```
/opt/sensu/embedded/bin$ /opt/sensu/embedded/bin/ruby check-influxdb-metrics.rb --host=metrics-influxdb.internal.com --port=8086 --user=admin --password=password -c -3 -w -10 --db=statsd_metrics --metric=api.request.counter
```

If you have a tag you can filter your metrics by doing, for example:
```
ruby check-influxdb-metrics.rb --host=metrics-influxdb.internal.com --port=8086 --user=admin --password=password -c -20 -w -10 --db=statsd_metrics --metric=api.request.counter --tag=datacenter --filter=ci

```

You can set the period that you want for your queries, for example:
```
ruby check-influxdb-metrics.rb --host=metrics-influxdb.internal.com --port=8086 --user=admin --password=password -c -20 -w -10 --db=statsd_metrics --metric=api.request.counter --tag=datacenter --filter=ci --period=1440

```

##Â Advanced Queries

You can use Regex in your metrics. The spirit behind this feature is to gather information about exceptions only, always aiming for a zero exception policy. So I'll advise against using it for other purposes.

**How it works**
1. It will understand that is a regex only when the metric name contains '/'. In the bash you'll need to include your metric inside double quotes.
2. It will compare the number of metrics gathered today vs the number of metrics gathered yesterday.
3. If today we read more than yesterday, it will blow up as **Critical**.
4. If today we read the same number of metrics than yesterday, at the moment it will compare only the first one.
I'll not rely on this tool (yet) for a deep analysis of differences when comparing multiple metrics (such as exceptions) using Regex.
```
ruby check-influxdb-metrics.rb --host=metrics-influxdb.internal.com --port=8086 --user=admin --password=password -c -20 -w -10 --db=statsd_metrics --metric="/^prefix.datacenter.([A-Za-z0-9-]+).([A-Za-z0-9-]+).exceptions$/"

```


## Lessons learnt
The InfluxDb query language that we used is not the latest, you can find it here:

[InfluxDb query language](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.10/query_language/)

What matters for this program is that:
**When doing a query**:
```
-24h will turn into bad request
- 24h good
```

**When passing parameters**
```
-c=-3 Will be transform as 0.0.
-c -3 counts as a number
```
